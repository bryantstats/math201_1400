# Why Sampling?

- Gathering information about an entire population often costs too much or is virtually impossible. 

- Instead, we use a sample of the population.

- How to form a sample? 

---
# Principal

- A sample should have the same characteristics as the population it is representing.

# Hypothesiss

Students in our class (Math201) like Basketball more than Football.

# Multiple ways to Sample

- Simple Random Sampling

- Systematic Sampling

- Stratify Sampling

- Convenience Sampling (Not recommended!)

# Simple Random Sampling

---
# Simple Random Sampling

- Step 1: Number all items in the population

- Step 2: Decide the sample size

- Step 3: Use a random number generator to select items/data for the sample

# Population

![](class_list.png)

---
- Let say we want to go with a sample size of 30% population. 

- We would need about 35*.3 = 10 or 11 data points. 

- Use a random number generator to generate a random number, for example

- Collect data from the students associated with the generated numbers. 


---
# Systematic Sampling

- Step 1: Number all items in the population

- Step 2: Pick a random number, says 7, then select items starting from 7, 8, 9...to a desired number. 

---
# Stratified Sampling

- Breaks down the population into groups

- Randomly select items from each groups

- The proportion of each group in your samples and the proportion of each group  in your population should be similar. 

---
# Convenience Sampling (Not recommended!)

- Conveniently select items from the population

- For example: Only collect data from the people you know
