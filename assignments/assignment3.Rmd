1. Form a simple hypothesis about our class.  

2. Use the **stratified sampling** method to collect sample data with the sample size of 30% the population size. You could randomly select your classmates *for each group* in your sample to collect data. Please notice that the proportion of each group in your samples and the proportion of each group  in your population should be similar.
