Work in pair. Write down your answers to all the questions. Show the instructor in class for credits. 


1. Form a proportion population hypothesis about class of 2025 at Bryant. Write down both the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).

2. Collect data from your classmates to test the hypothesis.  Your sample size must be at least 30. 

3. Use Minitab to calculate the p-value.  Is the p-value small (less than .05)?  Does the data support your hypothesis?
